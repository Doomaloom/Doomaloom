# Frank Kocun

Computer Science @ University of Toronto Mississauga
Aspiring Backend / Full-Stack Software Engineer  

I build structured, production-minded systems that replace manual workflows with scalable software.

My focus: backend architecture, API design, data modeling, and AI-integrated applications.

## 🚀 Highlighted Projects

### 🏊 DeckSupervisor.ca  
Operations platform for aquatics programs replacing fragmented Excel + PDF workflows.

Designed a role-aware system supporting scheduling, roster workflows, report card pipelines, and print automation.

**Architecture Highlights**
- Go backend (net/http + gorilla/mux)
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS)
- Chromium-based PDF rendering (chromedp) + document orchestration
- Hashed persistence model to reduce PII exposure
- Team/term/session-based data modeling aligned with real operational boundaries
- Containerized deployment

Focus: backend structure, permission boundaries, document pipelines, system reliability.

Tech: Go, React, TypeScript, Supabase, Postgres, Tailwind

### 🧠 ProtoBop  
AI-assisted web prototyping workspace that converts product ideas or visual references into editable website experiences.

Bridges concept → structured generation → targeted refinement → codeless workspace.

**System Highlights**
- Dual-entry architecture (idea-first & reference-first)
- Structured tree-based generation pipeline
- Mask-based visual refinement system
- Embedded Gemini-powered coding agent (in progress)
- Supabase auth + RLS-backed persistence
- Media preprocessing pipeline (Sharp)

Focus: AI orchestration, structured generation, full-stack workflow design.

Tech: Next.js (App Router), React 18, Supabase, Gemini API, Ideogram API

### 📂 Job Application Central  
Full-stack job tracking + resume generation system with AI optimization.

**System Highlights**
- Go backend with protected REST endpoints
- Supabase Postgres integration
- JWT-secured routes
- LaTeX-based PDF generation pipeline
- AI-powered resume & cover letter optimization
- GitHub repository import integration

Focus: API security, structured JSON modeling, document automation.

Tech: Go, React (Vite), Supabase, LaTeX, Gemini API
